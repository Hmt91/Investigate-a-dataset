# Investigate-a-dataset
About Using Clean Dataset (IMDB data from 2006 to 2016) from "Kaggle" to investigate as a project in the Udasity data analysis course.

This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected fromThe Movie Database (TMDb),including user ratings and revenue.
● Certain columns, like ‘cast’
and ‘genres’, contain multiple
values separated by pipe (|)
characters.
● There are some odd characters
in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry
about cleaning them. You can
leave them as is.
● The final two columns ending
with “_adj” show the budget and
revenue of the associated movie
in terms of 2010 dollars,
accounting for inflation over
time.
